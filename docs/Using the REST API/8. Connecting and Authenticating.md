### Licensing

While there is a specific license point for the REST API, by default all Platform installations are given access to the API.

The REST API is a component of the Platform’s Application Server. On hosted systems, it is available by default to all customers.

### Instance Information You Will Need

To be able to connect with the REST API, you will need to know the instance:

-   Base URL e.g. ‘https://example.com’ (The same base url you use to access your system)
-   Database name e.g. ‘DEMO1’

For systems installed prior to mid 2023, you may also require the port number. All later systems are now setup with a proxy to avoid the need to know the port number.

If you do not have this information, please contact Xytech Technical Support.


## Authenticating

The REST API currently uses Basic Authentication and will require a database login account.  
Always use HTTPS encrypted protocol when communicating with the REST API to ensure credentials are not passed in clear text.
