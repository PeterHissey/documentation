The REST architecture is described in <a href="https://helpcenter.xytechsystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/20339398168219#h_01HF387Q6QAWSQ2EZMVZPAYQ1J">REST Basics</a></td></tr><tr><td>Verb</td><td>In REST, this is the programmatic method used to initiate an API command, usually GET, PUT, POST, or DELETE. See also <a href="https://helpcenter.xytechsystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/20339398168219#h_01HF42TTJMW7WJRZ5CQ9GZMFSB">HTTP Methods</a> for more information.</td></tr><tr><td><br>Swagger</td><td>A third-party tool that generates API documentation automatically based on the Open API specification. It presents a browsable, usable Web site as a URL within the API Web service. See also Open API.</td></tr><tr><td>cURL</td><td>cURL is a mechanism for transferring data using networking protocols. It is provided in two ways:<br>• As a command line tool that allows a user to submit requests directly and see the results, usually for testing purposes.<br>• As a library with integrations to several common programming languages, including C++, C#, PHP, and others.</td></tr><tr><td>Model</td><td>A collection of properties, usually defined as name/value pairs or collections of name/value pairs, that make up a document or a portion of a document. An API may accept one or more models as input, to create a new record or modify an existing record using all the specified values. An API may also provide one or more models as output, either as a list of identical models (e.g., retrieving multiple records as part of a list document) or as a collection of related models (e.g., retrieving all models related to a particular Job document).</td></tr><tr><td>Postman</td><td><p>A third-party platform for building and testing APIs; the Postman client application is available on several operating systems and provides a set of tools to test API calls without having to write code and helps debug API calls and response payloads. <a href="https://www.postman.com/">https://www.postman.com/</a></p></td></tr><tr><td>OAS,<br>OpenAPI</td><td>Formerly known as Swagger Specification, the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard interface to RESTful APIs. This language-agnostic interface can then be used by code generation, documentation generation, and testing tools to access and understand the underlying API.&nbsp;<br>Refer to <a href="https://swagger.io/specification/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://swagger.io/specification/</a> for more information.</td></tr></tbody></table>
