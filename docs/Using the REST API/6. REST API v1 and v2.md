#### **Deprecation of v1 API**

-   REST API v1 was the first Xytech REST API product. It had limitations that required breaking changes to improve so v2 was made available from Xytech v9.4 release with improved functionality.
-   REST API v1 will no longer be supported in version 11.0 and beyond.
-   All new integrations should use v2 API and existing integrations should port to v2
-   To use v2 API, change the base URL version number from ../v1/.. to ../v2/..

#### **Additional Features in v2 API (as of Platform v10.2 release)**

-   **Payload structure is enhanced and updated to be more robust and scalable.**  
    The document name is now always added as the root element of the payload with an array containing the details. 

  
_Example showing the additional root element jm\_job:  
_

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>API V1 JSON payload for GET JmJob</strong></td><td><p><strong>API V2 JSON payload for GET JmJob</strong></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<table><tbody><tr><td><p>/JmJob/job_no=11261</p><div><p><img src="Media%20Operations%20Platform%20REST%20API%20Reference%20-%2010.6%20%E2%80%93%20Xytech%20Systems/21892325750043.png" alt="Picture4.png"></p></div></td><td><p>/JmJob/job_no=11261</p><div><p><img src="Media%20Operations%20Platform%20REST%20API%20Reference%20-%2010.6%20%E2%80%93%20Xytech%20Systems/21892325781275.png" alt="Picture5.png" width="305" height="310"></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table>

-   -   See the Swagger documentation for details of the JSON structure for each endpoint.
-   **Additional PATCH capabilities  
    **In addition to the existing v1 PATCH method where each changed field must be defined using the operation/path/value payload structure, you can now use the same JSON payload you would use for a POST call to update a record. This needs to use the header 'Content-Type: application/json-patch+json'. [See the section below for more details.](https://helpcenter.xytechsystems.com/hc/en-us/articles/21789230412571-Media-Operations-Platform-REST-API-Reference-10-6#h_01HF36JJ5WR17BWBNHKZZCCQR1)

-   **Pagination & sorting  
    **API Pagination has been added to the REST API ‘Get’ Query for Lists.  
    **Parameters for:**
    
    <table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>pageSize&nbsp;</strong></p></td><td>are the number of records returned per page.&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>page</strong></td><td>are the page number to return.&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>sort</strong>&nbsp;</p></td><td>is the field to sort by followed by ascending or descending order.&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table>
    
    Example:  
    To return the first 10 records on page 1 sorted by product\_no:  
    GET  
    {server}}/JmOrgProductList?query="active":"Y"}&resultColumns="L":"product\_no","product\_desc"\]}&sort="product\_no\_desc"\]&pageSize=10&page=1
    
    This will allow sites to call for data in manageable payloads without exceeding memory limitations.
