From Platform version v10.2, a Swagger index page has been introduced to assist in the navigation and creation of Swagger YAML documentation. The Swagger index page can be found by entering the base URL you use for accessing the Platform and adding “/ApiDocs” to the end (e.g., www.xytechexample.com/XYT\_TEST/ApiDocs). The Xytech API Index page is displayed.

**Using the Index**  
The Index is comprised of the following areas:

-   Version: Displayed in the upper left corner of the screen. This shows the API version, currently either v1 or v2.
-   Selected Database: The name of the database currently selected for this host.  
    Only modules for that database are shown.
-   Available Databases: (Where multiple databases exist on the same host) Click a database to select it and view its associated modules.
-   Filter Documents: Enter text into this field and press \[Enter\] to only display matching document descriptions. To clear the filter, delete the text and press \[Enter\].
-   Module and Document List: Only modules in the selected database are displayed. Click any Module to expand and show the documents it contains. Each document has a label that describes its type (Document \[maintenance\], List, or Setup).

#### **For versions prior to v10.2**

For versions prior to v10.2 you will need to generate the Swagger documentation manually for each document endpoint.

Use a browser to generate the Swagger document:

http://{host}:{port}/API/v2/database/{db\_name}/spec/{docName}

For example:

http://myhost:8088/API/v2/database/mp10/spec/JmJob

The above URL will generate the Swagger document and then display the Swagger document.

To display generated Swagger documents, browse to:

http://{host}:{port}/REST/SwaggerUI/dist/index.html?document={docName}\_v2

For example:

http://myhost:8088/REST/SwaggerUI/dist/index.html?document=JmDivision\_v2
